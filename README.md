# DummyGenerator

To be used with [My Nikko's Dummy File Creator](https://www.mynikko.com/dummy/).

This script will create a batch file than can be used with Dummy File Creator (the above software). It will also make sure that the folder structure needed for the files exists. This is important because Dummy File Creator requires any directories in the batch file to already be created.

# Script Settings

## `filesAtEachLevel`
How many dummy files to put in each folder.

## `branchesAtEachLevel`
How many branches (folders) should be inside each folder.

## `depth`
How deep the file tree should go.

## `fileSizeRange`
A minimum and maximum file size.

## `startLocation`
